The idea here is to give a simple multiple choice question for how likely you are to
attend a thing.
Each option should be understandable to non-nerds but also include a range of 
probabilities. For example:
</p>
<pre>
(a) I'm very probably coming! (&gt;90% chance)
(b) I'm maybe probably coming (&gt;50% chance)
(c) Unlikely this time but still hoping I can (&lt;50% chance)
(d) Sad trombone &mdash; I probably can't come! (&lt;10% chance)
</pre>        
<p>
And there could be an "other" option that makes you enter a specific probability.
Nerds can use that if they want something in between the given options &mdash;
like "quite likely" which might be, say, 80%.
And non-nerds could use it to say things like "definitely can't make it", ie, 0%, or 
"wouldn't miss it for the world", ie, 100%.
Or 50% for "right on the fence".
</p>
<p>
(Or maybe it's better to minimize the cognitive load by only allowing a fixed handful of 
choices. Roughly: yes, probably, probably not, and no.)  
</p>
<p>
Anyway, you end up with a list of people each with min and max probabilties.
(Anyone who picked "other" will have min=max, which is fine.)
So then you can get a range on the expected number of people who will show up.
Just add up the min probabilities for the lower bound and add up the max probabilities for
the upper bound.

That's not actually implemented yet so you can just type anything you want below but go
ahead and use it for a genuine RSVP for the 
<a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/pomopoker">Pomodoro Poker</a>
Hack Night at the
<a href="http://beeminder.com/contact">Beehive</a>.
Or if you think it would be fun to help build this thing in 
<a href="http://glitch.com" title="Glitch is the bees' knees">Glitch</a>,
which is super fun btw, go ahead and say so here:
</p>
<form>
  <input type="text" maxlength="100" placeholder="I'm probably maybe coming ish!">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<h3>Past case studies...</h3>
<p>
For the Slate Star Codex meetup on 2017-05-07:
The RSVProbably algorithm, as we could maybe call it, predicted 9.05 to 12.7 people.
Actual was 13 people at the peak but one person arrived not too much before the first 
person left.
If we count everyone's attendance fractionally 
based on arrival and departure time then the total attendance
was 10.25 people.
