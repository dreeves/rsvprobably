The idea here is to give a simple multiple choice question for how likely you are to
attend a thing.
Each option should be understandable to non-nerds but also include a range of 
probabilities. For example:
</p>
<pre>
(a) I'm definitely coming! (&gt;90% chance)
(b) I'm probably coming (&gt;50% chance)
(c) I'm unlikely this time but <i>want</i> to come (&lt;50% chance)
(d) Sad trombone &mdash; I probably can't come! (&lt;10% chance)
</pre>        
<p>
And there should be an "other" option that makes you enter a specific probability.
Nerds can use that if they want something in between the given options &mdash;
like "very likely" which might be, say, 85%.
And non-nerds can use it to say things like "definitely can't make it", ie, 0%, or 
"wouldn't miss it for the world", ie, 100%.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, you end up with a list of people each with min and max probabilties.
(The people who picked "other" will have min=max, which is fine.)
So then you can get a range on the expected number of people who will show up.
Just add up the min probabilities for the lower bound and add up the max probabilities for
the upper bound.

That's not actually implemented yet so you can just type anything you want below but go
ahead and use it for a genuine RSVP for the Slate Star Codex meetup in the meantime.
Or if you think it would be fun to help build this thing in 
<a href="http://glitch.com" title="Glitch is the bees' knees">Glitch</a>,
which is super fun btw, go ahead and say so here:
</p>
<form>
  <input type="text" maxlength="100" placeholder="I'm probably maybe coming ish!">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
